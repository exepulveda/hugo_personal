Exequiel Sep√∫lveda is a postdoctoral researcher fellow at the School of Civil, Environmental and Mining Engineering in The University of Adelaide. His research interests include machine learning, geostatistics, metaheuristics optimisation, high performance computing and digital mining. He loves programming .

After he completed his studies in Computer Science, Exequiel had almost 20 years experience in software engineering, working in industries in the financial, insurances and energy sectors, among others. That experience brought him to work in the Mining School at The University of Chile, where his became a researcher assistant in the ALGES laboratory.
