abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and The AusIMM Published by Taylor  {\&}  Francis on behalf of the Institute and The AusIMM The incorporation of the uncertainties of geometallurgical variables in mine planning provides new opportunities for decision-makers to analyse, compare and choose among many scenarios to achieve an optimal balance between economic and operational objectives. This research focuses on maximising economic return and minimising the risk arising from the uncertainty associated with geometallurgical variables. We formulate two-objective optimisation problems based on an underground mining operation. The first objective is the maximisation of the Net Smelter Return, which includes penalties associated with deleterious elements in concentrates. Four different objectives were tested as candidates for the second objective: Volatility, Value at Risk, Conditional Value at Risk and deviation from the planned production target. The first three are measures of economic risk and the fourth is a measure of operational risk. Uncertainties in metal grades, geometallurgical recoveries and grades in concentrate are included in the proposed model. Our results demonstrate that geometallurgical uncertainties can be successfully integrated into production scheduling optimisation in a multi-objective approach and the problem can be solved using genetic algorithms to yield useful conclusions to support the decision-making process.},

abstract = {The wear rate of working tools during the cutting and drilling of rocks is closely related to the abrasiveness of those rocks. As the contact area of the tools increases, due to wear, the specific cutting energy will also increase, and that directly affects the overall consumption of excavation tools. A new artificial intelligence (AI) based model has been developed. It utilizes acoustic emission (AE) and rock properties as main indicators of rock abrasivity, estimated by Cerchar Abrasivity Index (CAI). AE sensors are attached to both the Cerchar testing apparatus and the rock in question while conducting scratch tests using hardened steel pins of 42 and 56 HRC. Prior to the implementation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling, the selection of independent variables was carried out via Gamma test and V-ratio analyses. As a result, AE parameters, such as total number of events and root mean square of signal, in addition to testing parameters (i.e. uniaxial compressive strength, Young[U+05F3]s Modulus, quartz content and pin hardness) are found to be the optimum model input combination needed to accurately predict CAI.},

abstract = {Simulation of continuous variables is an important aspect in the construction of numerical models of Earth Sciences variables. In many cases, there is a need for high resolution models either to model large volumes or surfaces, or to characterize on a very dense grid some spatial phenomena. Traditional simulation algorithms such as turning bands and sequential Gaussian simulation must be adapted to handle such large models and to perform the computations in a reasonable time. Parallelization requires a review of the algorithm design. We present the changes and performance improvements of parallelizing the turning bands algorithm using graphical processing units (GPU). Our implementation focuses on parallelization of the unconditional simulation step. One example is presented comparing the performance of a serial simulation implementation versus our parallelized implementation of turning bands. Speed ups of up to 60 are reached and an analysis of possible additional improvements is presented.},

abstract = {Mine planning in open pit defines the material to be extracted, when it will be extracted and its destination. Conventional scheduling usually considers block values based on geological parameters such as grade of the metal of interest, its mineralogy, and parameters external to geology. The latter parameters correspond, for example, to economic parameters, opportunity costs, types of plant and plant processes. The scope of this research is to consider geometallurgical constraints into the optimization problem known in mine planning as constrained pit limit problem (CPIT). In the last years, numerous works have proven that there is a strong effect of clays on the flotation recovery process (chalcopyrite or bornite minerals). This impact generates operational problems that, if not controlled, can decrease metallurgical recovery. For example, due to clays are usually soft rocks, the grinding time is modified, thus, the recovery which is related to the granulometry. In addition, clays increase the costs associated on water input, since they require additional consumption to obtain the expected recovery. All these factors can be handled over long periods of time, but in short times operation the response is not as immediate and effective as required to be economical. In this work, we propose a methodology which add a homogeneity condition to the optimization problem. It consists in the extraction of minerals with similar geometallurgical properties (in this case, the modeled amount of clay) on each period, and therefore the operational parameters in the plant would remain relatively the same. The algorithm was applied to a case study where zones with different levels of alteration and clay content were modeled. The valuation considered standard economic parameters of the mining industry.},

abstract = {The integration of geological and geometallurgical data can significantly improve decision-making and optimize mining production due to a better understanding of the resources and their metallurgical performances. The primary-response rock property framework is an approach to the modelling of geometallurgy in which quantitative and qualitative primary properties are used as proxies of metallurgical responses. Within this framework, primary variables are used to fit regression models to predict metallurgical responses. Whilst primary rock property data are relatively abundant, metallurgical response property data are not, which makes it difficult to establish predictive response relationships. Relationships between primary input variables and geometallurgical responses are, in general, complex, and the response variables are often non-additive which further complicates the prediction process. Consequently, in many cases, the traditional multivariate linear regression models (MLR) of primary-response relationships perform poorly and a better alternative is required for prediction. Projection pursuit is a powerful exploratory statistical modelling technique in which data from a number of variables are projected onto a set of directions that optimize the fit of the model. The purpose of the projection is to reveal underlying relationships. Projection pursuit regression (PPR) fits standard regression models to the projected data vectors. In this paper, PPR is applied to the modelling of geometallurgical response variables. A case study with six geometallurgical variables is used to demonstrate the modelling approach. The results from the proposed PPR models show a significant improvement over those from MLR models. In addition, the models were bootstrapped to generate distributions of feasible scenarios for the response variables. Our results show that PPR is a robust technique for modelling geometallurgical response variables and for assessing the uncertainty associated with these variables.},

abstract = {Geometallurgy is an inter-disciplinary approach to improving decision-making and optimising production in the mining industry by integrating geological and metallurgical data and knowledge. Improvements come from a better understanding of the resources and their metallurgical performance and by optimising over the complete mining value chain. The primary-response rock property framework is an approach to geometallurgy in which primary properties such as grades, lithology, alteration and mineralogy are proxies of important metallurgical responses; for example, recovery, comminution and energy use. Using this framework, primary variables are used to predict key response variables. Primary rock properties, typically geological, geotechnical and structural, are relatively abundant compared with metallurgical response properties, making the integration of the latter more difficult. Moreover, the relationship between geometallurgical input variables and their processing responses is usually complex and the response variables are often non-additive which complicates the prediction process. Consequently, in many cases, traditional multi-linear regression models (MLR) are not good predictors and non-linear models may be a better alternative. Projection Pursuit is a powerful exploratory statistics technique, in which promising directions are found and data are projected on to these directions to reveal underlying relationships. In particular, Projection Pursuit Regression (PPR) finds several directions in which the variance explained by the projected data is maximised, which enables more accurate predictions to be made. In this paper we present a case study in which six geometallurgical response variables are modelled by PPR of primary properties. The results from the proposed PPR models show a significant improvement over those from MLR models. In addition, as the quantification of uncertainty is a key aspect of risk management, the models were bootstrapped to generate a distribution of feasible scenarios. Our results show that PPR is a robust technique for modelling geometallurgical response variables and their uncertainty.},
